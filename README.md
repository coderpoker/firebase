My first cloud based function :-

This is a firebased function which post's "Hello World" message to the users.
I have used basic Javascript with node js and npm to create this project.
I really think this can be a game changer when it comes to building serverless applications , it has redundant language support 
as well as very easy to set up.

My repo consists of my index.js file where i'll be coding most of the stuff essentially , you can use it to create many other cloud 
based functions , databases etc.
Also this was a very interesting task given to me by Scorelab's.#GCI

here are some screenshots:-
